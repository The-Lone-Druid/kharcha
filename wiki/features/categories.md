# Categories (Outflow Types)

Categories help you organize your expenses into meaningful groups for better tracking and analysis.

---

## What are Categories?

Categories (also called "Outflow Types" in the app) classify your expenses:
- Food & Dining
- Transportation
- Shopping
- Entertainment
- etc.

Every transaction must have a category, which enables:
- Spending breakdown by category
- Budget tracking per category
- Trend analysis

## Category Anatomy

### Name

- Keep it short but descriptive
- Use title case: "Food & Dining"
- Avoid abbreviations

### Emoji

Choose an emoji that:
- Represents the category at a glance
- Is easily recognizable
- Works well in lists

### Color

Colors appear in:
- Transaction cards
- Charts and graphs
- Category badges

**Color Tips:**
- Use distinct colors for major categories
- Group similar categories with similar hues
- Avoid colors too close to each other

---

## Managing Categories

### Editing a Category

1. Go to **Categories**
2. Click on the category to edit
3. Modify name, emoji, or color
4. Click **Save**

Changes apply to:
- All future transactions
- All existing transactions (retroactively)
- Budget displays

### Deleting a Category

**⚠️ Warning:** You can only delete a category with no transactions.

To delete a category in use:
1. First, reassign all its transactions to another category
2. Then delete the category

This prevents accidental data loss.

---

## Extra Fields (Advanced)

Categories can have custom metadata fields:

### Field Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| **Text** | Notes, descriptions |
| **Number** | Quantities, measurements |
| **Date** | Due dates, expiry dates |
| **Toggle** | Yes/No flags |

### Example: Subscription Category

For a "Subscriptions" category, you might add:
- `renewalDate` (Date) - When it renews
- `isAnnual` (Toggle) - Annual vs monthly
- `serviceName` (Text) - Name of service

These fields appear when adding transactions with this category.

## Category Strategy

### Keep it Simple

**Recommended:** 8-15 categories

Too few:
- ❌ Everything is "Other"
- ❌ No useful insights

Too many:
- ❌ Decision fatigue when logging
- ❌ Overcomplicated analysis
- ❌ Categories with 1-2 transactions

### Hierarchy Thinking

Think in levels:

**Level 1 (Broad):**
- Food
- Transport
- Housing

**Level 2 (Specific):**
- Groceries, Restaurants, Coffee
- Fuel, Uber, Metro
- Rent, Utilities, Maintenance

For most users, Level 1 is sufficient. Only go to Level 2 if you need that detail.

### Review Periodically

Every few months:
1. Check which categories are rarely used
2. Consider merging low-use categories
3. Add categories for new recurring expenses
4. Remove outdated categories

---

## Category Best Practices

### 1. Choose the Right Level

**Too broad:**
- "Expenses" ❌

**Too narrow:**
- "Tuesday Morning Coffee" ❌

**Just right:**
- "Food & Dining" ✅
- "Coffee & Snacks" ✅ (if you want to track separately)

### 2. Be Consistent

When in doubt:
- "Grocery shopping" → Food & Dining
- "Restaurant dinner" → Food & Dining
- "Coffee at cafe" → Food & Dining

Don't overthink categorization.

### 3. Use Notes for Details

Instead of creating many categories, use notes:
- Category: "Food & Dining"
- Note: "Weekly groceries from BigBasket"

### 4. Match Your Budget Goals

If you're budgeting for something, have a category for it:
- Want to reduce eating out? → Have a "Restaurants" category
- Want to track coffee habit? → Have a "Coffee" category

## Category Colors in Charts

In pie charts and graphs:
- Each category shows in its assigned color
- Make sure colors are distinct
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes

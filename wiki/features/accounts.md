## Creating an Account

### Step-by-Step

4. Click **Save**

### Naming Conventions

## Account Balance

### How Balance is Calculated

Your account balance is calculated automatically:

```
Balance = Sum of all transactions for this account
```

**Note:**

- Expenses are subtracted (shown as negative in transactions)
- The balance shown is based on your logged transactions
- It may not match your actual bank balance if you haven't logged all transactions

### Keeping Balance Accurate

1. **Log all transactions** - Every expense and income
2. **Use the correct account** - Select carefully when adding transactions
3. **Review regularly** - Compare with actual bank statements
4. **Reconcile monthly** - Match Kharcha balance with real balance

## Managing Accounts

### Editing an Account

1. Go to **Accounts**
2. Click on the account you want to edit
3. Modify the details
4. Click **Save**

You can change:

- Name
- Type
- Color

### Archiving an Account

If you no longer use an account but don't want to delete the transaction history:

1. Edit the account
2. Toggle **"Archive"** on
3. Save

Archived accounts:

- Don't appear in transaction dropdowns
- Still show in reports (with historical data)
- Can be unarchived anytime

### Deleting an Account

**⚠️ Warning:** You can only delete an account if it has no transactions.

To delete:

1. First, delete or reassign all transactions
2. Then delete the account

This prevents accidental data loss.

## Account Colors

Colors help you quickly identify accounts:

### Color Strategy

- Use your bank's brand colors for bank accounts
- Use distinct colors for different types
- Keep credit cards in warm colors (red/orange) as visual reminder

### Example Color Scheme

```
HDFC Bank    - Blue (#2563EB)
SBI Bank     - Green (#16A34A)
ICICI Card   - Orange (#EA580C)
Cash         - Yellow (#CA8A04)
Google Pay   - Teal (#0D9488)
```

## Account Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Create all accounts upfront** - Set up before you start tracking
2. **Be specific** - "HDFC Salary Account" not just "Bank"
3. **Use realistic types** - Helps with future analytics
4. **Color consistently** - Same bank = same color family

### Common Mistakes

1. **Too few accounts** - Lumping everything into "Bank"
2. **Too many accounts** - Creating accounts you rarely use
3. **Wrong types** - UPI app marked as "Bank"
4. **No organization** - Random colors, unclear names

### Recommended Setup

For most users, start with:

- 1-2 Bank accounts (primary and savings)
- 1 Cash account
- 1 Credit card (if you use one)
- 1 UPI account (if you use digital payments)

Add more as needed.

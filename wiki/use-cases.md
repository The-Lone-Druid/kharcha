   - Cash wallet
   - Any credit cards you use

2. **Set Monthly Budgets**
   - Food & Dining: ₹8,000
   - Transportation: ₹3,000
   - Entertainment: ₹2,000
   - Shopping: ₹5,000

3. **Daily Routine**

   - Check dashboard weekly to see budget progress

### Tips

## Tracking Multiple Bank Accounts

**Scenario:** You have multiple bank accounts (savings, salary, etc.) and want to track them all.

### Setup

1. **Create Separate Accounts**

   ```
   💳 HDFC Salary Account - Bank - Blue
   💳 SBI Savings - Bank - Green
   💳 ICICI Fixed Deposit - Bank - Orange
   ```

2. **Color Code Strategy**
   - Use different colors for different banks
   - Makes it easy to identify at a glance

3. **Transaction Tracking**
   - Always select the correct account when logging
   - Track transfers between accounts as separate transactions

### Best Practices

- Log only the accounts you actively use
- Archive dormant accounts instead of deleting
- Review account balances monthly

---

## Managing Credit Card Expenses

**Scenario:** You use credit cards and want to track spending without double-counting.

### Setup

1. **Create Credit Card Accounts**

   ```
   💳 HDFC Credit Card - Credit Card - Red
   💳 ICICI Amazon Card - Credit Card - Orange
   ```

2. **Tracking Strategy**
   - Log purchases when you make them (to the credit card account)
   - Don't log the payment from bank → credit card (it's not an expense)
   - Or: Only log when you pay the credit card bill

### Option A: Track Each Purchase

```
Purchase: ₹500 at Restaurant
→ Account: HDFC Credit Card
→ Category: Food & Dining
```

**Pros:** Accurate spending tracking, real-time insights
**Cons:** More logging effort

### Option B: Track Monthly Bill

```
Credit Card Bill: ₹15,000
→ Account: HDFC Savings (when you pay)
→ Category: Credit Card Payment (create this category)
```

**Pros:** Less effort
**Cons:** Less granular insights

### Recommendation

Use Option A for detailed tracking. Create a habit of logging right after each swipe.

## Tracking Subscriptions

**Scenario:** You have Netflix, Spotify, gym membership, and other recurring expenses.

### Setup

1. **Use the Subscription Feature**
   - Dashboard → Add Subscription
   - Enter each recurring expense

   | Netflix | ₹649 | Entertainment | 15th |
   | Spotify | ₹119 | Entertainment | 1st |
   | Gym | ₹2,000 | Healthcare | 5th |
   | iCloud | ₹75 | Other | 20th |

3. **Monthly Review**
   - Check if all subscriptions are still needed
   - Cancel unused services
   - Track total subscription costs

### Subscription Audit Questions

- When did I last use this service?
- Is there a cheaper alternative?
- Can I share with family?
- Is annual billing cheaper?

### Example Workflow

## Splitting Expenses

**Scenario:** You went to dinner with friends and need to track only your share.

### Approach 1: Log Your Share Only

```
Dinner at Restaurant - ₹500 (your share)
Account: Cash
Category: Food & Dining
Note: "Dinner with college friends, split 4 ways, total was ₹2,000"
```

### Approach 2: Log Full Amount with Note

```
Dinner at Restaurant - ₹2,000 (full bill)
Account: Credit Card
Category: Food & Dining
Note: "Paid full bill, to be split with 3 friends (₹500 each)"
```

Then track money received separately (if using Approach 2).
